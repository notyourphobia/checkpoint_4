            If you think you can, well come on man
    I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
    No more of your fairy stories
    'Cause I got my other worries
    Fifty-third and third standing on the street
    Fifty-third and third I'm tryin' to turn a trick
    Fifty-third and third you're the one they never pick
    Fifty-third and third don't it make you feel sick?
    If you think you can, well come on man
    I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
    No more of your fairy stories
    'Cause I got my other worries
    Fifty-third and third standing on the street
    Fifty-third and third I'm tryin' to turn a trick
    Fifty-third and third you're the one they never pick
    Fifty-third and third don't it make you feel sick?
    Then I took out my razor blade
    Then I did what God forbade
    Now the cops are after me
    But I proved that I'm no sissy
    Fifty-third and third standing on the street
    Fifty-third and third I'm tryin' to turn a trick
    Fifty-third and third you're the one they never pick
    Fifty-third and third don't it make you feel sick?
    Fifty-third and third
    Fifty-third and third
    Fifty-third and third
    Fifty-third and third
    Fifty-third and third
    Fifty-third and third
    Fifty-third and third
