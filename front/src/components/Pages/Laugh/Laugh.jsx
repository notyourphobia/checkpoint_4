            We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    Siting here in Queens
    Eating refried beans
    We're in all the magazines
    Gulpin' down Thorazines
    We ain't got no friends
    Our troubles never end
    No Christmas cards to send
    Daddy likes men
    Daddy's telling lies
    Baby's eating flies
    Mommy's on pills
    Baby's got the chills
    I'm friends with the President
    I'm friends with the Pope
    We're all making a fortune selling Daddy's dope
    Siting here in Queens
    Eating refried beans
    We're in all the magazines
    Gulpin' down Thorazines
    We ain't got no friends
    Our troubles never end
    No Christmas cards to send
    Daddy likes men
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
    We're a happy family, we're a happy family
    We're a happy family, me, mom and daddy
